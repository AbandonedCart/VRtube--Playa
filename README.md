# VRtube--Playa
v0.0.2

Welcome to the VRtube holographic player source code!
In order to actually watch holograms on the device, you'll need to download holographic files from VRtube.


We'd really like to see some inverse kinematics on the avatar, and some cooler environments.

If you have any questions, please hit me up at source@vrtube.xxx
